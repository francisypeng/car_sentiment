32,33,PiechsSwanSong,"A follow up answer to a question yesterday about the brake line. No work needed to be done to the brake line, but the brake fluid was serviced at 44k along with the coolant and spark plugs and fuel filter and rear differential fluid. The rear differential fluid did not need to be done and is not a service item, but I had MacLane do it anyway. He had done it on one of my other Phaetons many years ago.
And the question from today from jmatters. This was the same bill where he did the replacement of the oil filter housing gaskets and Gruvenparts coolant tube, which by itself cost $1573, but was cheaper than pulling the engine out to replace the plastic piece.
A further comment to jmatters. I lowered my other four seater for awhile because it looks better when it is set to the Europe ride height which is 10mm lower than North America. I returned it to North American settings because our curbs and concrete stopping blocks are too high. Protruding vertical rebar in concrete stops is a problem. I prefer to back up to them, but if that is not an option, I stop earlier. If perchance, I misjudge, I raise the car an inch before I back away.
The suspension automatically lowers it self from the higher ride height at around 60 miles an hour. My wife and one of my sons prefers the extra height. With the new struts it lowers around 50 mph. It lowers an additional 0.6 inch at 87 mph after 30 seconds, or 100 mph immediately.
In addition to ride height, the other thing that can make the wheel wells seem smaller, is to put the 19 inch Bentley wheels on them, which both of my sons have and my wife does too, but she does not like the ""B"" in the center cap, so I have gone with a generic black cap for her. That is the wheel that was intended for the car and trues up the speedometer. With the 18"" wheels, the speedometer is off by about 4%.",,Reputation Icon9,1

FYI - Mine has the Euro spec struts that are 11mm lower than the US spec units. I did not put them in; the prior owner did.

A Blue Angel working at the airline where I worked, had purchased a new V-8 and he told me before I purchased one, to be careful. You end up going faster than you think. That tendency would be even worse with the W-12. I have had to be careful not to get a ticket. I will ask the mechanic that question as well. I think there are a few tasks that require the W-12 engine to be removed. One friend thinks the front end of the W-12 is too heavy, but I don't know.

It may be that I forgot a step in the VCDS programming.",,Reputation Icon9,1
58,59,PiechsSwanSong,"Thank you. Phaeton owners are often fussy and pedantic. I take note of your comments on the two car garages. I agree. If I had a three car garage, this would not be for sale.
In the VCDS printout, the navigation issue shows up quite a few times. That is because I had VW take out the Navigation because it was slowly draining the left AGM 49 series battery. Apart from not having navigation, it is no problem at all. I left it connected in my wife's car, because she drives it every day and the battery gets recharged. I will include it with the car.
I forgot about the sunshade window until the photographer showed up. The sunshade window handle came off and the window is inside the door. I have never seen the condition of the shade but I suspect it is fine. I have left the window shades retracted so that they didn't stretch the springs.
The parking sensors work well.
My other four seater takes a little while to warm up the parking sensors for some reason. Ross Tech borrowed it to refine their VCDS magic and they noticed it. But the sensors are fine on this car.",,Reputation Icon9,1

61,62,Dunesguy,"Firstly, my compliments for your presentation of the this Phaeton; I have learned much by your example.
Based on my thus far cursory reading of the volumes of documents you provided (again, my compliments), I saw there were some issues with the navigation and backup systems…have they been addressed and resolved? Also, I noticed in the photos that the sunshade for the right rear door’s small window is not visible. Is the sunshade still intact or has the handle simplly been pulled off? (I have experience with this problem on my 2005 Phaeton…the sunshade handle was missing when I bought the car on the BaT auction site. I was able to source a replacement sunshade on Ebay with the handle intact and removed the handle from the newly purchased sunshade and affixed it to the previously-unseen-yet-still-attached sunshade in the window frame.)
I look forward to seeing this auction progress. The only downside is if I am the successful bidder, I wil have to sell my 2005 Pheton since the winters on the southern shores of Lake Michigan are not kind to vintage cars sitting outside (2 car garage!). GLWTA!",,Reputation Icon11,0
62,63,PiechsSwanSong,"I have two guys who work on my Phaetons. Flick at Garnet VW and MacLane who used to work at Garnet. Both competed in the cadre of VWs best ten mechanics. (www.maclanesauto.com)
I think you have identified a reasonable problem. The cars, in my experience are so well built and are so durable that when you occasionally encounter a problem with sourcing a new part, you need to go the the used car market. I purchased a pair of new side shades when I realized how low stocks were. But I probably won't use them.
They did tend to lead the field with all the patents that the design team got for the car. I suspect it set records in that area. The VW group coasted for awhile in the wake of the Phaeton and some of the technology ended up in the newer cars.

66,67,PiechsSwanSong,"I have a two car garage. My wife parks her five seater in one spot and this car is parked in the other. That leaves my four seater on the road out in the elements which it has done since I got this one in 2018. I have kept this in reserve in case one of the others had an accident or a significant enough problem. But I have given up.
My wife and son are safe drivers and the cars are reliable. If they have an accident before the sale goes through, it is off the market. This one is worth the most. There is also a small issue in that the others are 2005 models so they have the soft close doors. When I drive this one, being a creature of habit, I forget to close the door properly. (By the way, I saw a measurement about ten years ago, and only one car has a more sturdy door and it was a Bentley. You are buying a life insurance policy when you buy one of these.

No the struts are not leaking. But they are not as smooth as the replacement struts that VW installed on my other three Phaetons. On two of the cars, VW paid for three struts and the module and the labor, and I gladly paid for one strut. On the third car, they paid for two struts and the module and the labor and I paid for two struts. I was told that would be the deal if I had the new and improved struts installed on this car.

70,71,PiechsSwanSong,"I think there was a grand total of 200 four seaters in North America in the V-8 and W-12 configurations for 2004, 2005 and 2006. They can be identified by the fourth letter of the VIN B instead of A: WVWB vs WVWA. (Occasionally sellers would fold down the armrest in the rear and refer to it as a four seater. They would omit showing the front seat armrests as that was a giveaway.)
It was designed to be chauffer driven. If you end up in a wrestling match between the front seater and the back seater, over the fan speed of the climate controls, the back seater wins.
