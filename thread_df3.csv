Scent wise, no smoke or pets. Just smells like Mazda plastics and carpet. There was some small mildew from the old heater core leaking in driver carpet, but I cleaned it well with white vinegar a while ago.",,Reputation Icon421,1

24,25,kelman81,"Re: Stubaru
the stock shock setup on the R package is famously brutal. Those Bilsteins (which I took off and are included) are quite stiff and not well dampened, especially when compared to later NB Bilsteins. The new Tein coilovers are really great, and since they are 11 position adjustable I think I've found the right balance of comfort and performance for my taste. Doesn't roll nearly as much as a standard NA as it is sits 1 inch lower and has heavier sway bars. The 15 inch tires still give plenty of cushion, but it still feels like a stiff 2100 lb car when you hit an expansion joint at speed on the interstate.",,Reputation Icon421,1

34,35,kelman81,"Re: RStokes
I stumbled across adjusting the timing bump to 14 degrees on an old forum post one day. I was used to adjusting timing on my old MR2s and other vehicles where you could turn the distributor. Never thought it was possible on an engine like this without a mechanical distributor, but it makes sense by just adjusting the cam sensor.",,Reputation Icon421,1

Boy that takes me back...we bought our 93 C-package new about this time in 1992 - happy 30th anniversary to us! The original MCA (Miata Club of America) published a quarterly magazine, and bumping timing to 14 degrees was the first ""mod"" they recommended & that I did to ours (30 years later the timing is back to factory spec, but the K&N filter is still in there!).

41,42,kelman81,I did find an old photo of the driver seat showing the wear on the outside bolster and added it to the gallery. I will give the buyer the rest of my patch material so they can cut a larger wear patch when needed.,,Reputation Icon421,1
42,43,kelman81,"Re: grissfam
great to hear from a local! Yes, I put the patch on right after I got the car. It was really just that side bolster, it was becoming thread bare. The fabric was still holding the foam in, but you could start to see the foam. Let me see if I can find a picture.
The patch is a peel and stick leather patch called Masta Plasta from the UK. The stuff is incredible, it really holds and is very durable.",,Reputation Icon421,1

Hi there! Always fun to see some cars pop up around East TN, all the photos/videos helped give a great picture of this car and answered some questions but I was curious if you had an idea of the driver's seat condition under the patch. Is there a tear or the start of some wear that's being mitigated? The rest of them look to be in great condition!
Best of luck!",,Reputation Icon10,0

50,51,kelman81,"Hello! I am happy to see this auction get started and looking forward to participating in the discussion. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them here for everyone or message me individually and I will respond promptly.
Background on this car, I have known it since 2005. My former boss owned it and purchased it in Tennessee in 2002. He primarily commuted in the car down to his Navy Reserves base in Alabama or to the office in Knoxville or occasional road trip to our job site in southern Ohio. His mileage was 90% highway. When he retired in early 2019 and moved to Florida, I was happy to finally buy it from him! He had a lot of regular maintenance work performed on the car as you can see in the Carfax. After the minor accident he had with the car, he had it repaired and repainted in the same factory SU red but with clearcoat.
There was a surprise on the Carfax about the minor damage noted in June 2020. I have figured out this was when I went to a couple of body shops to get estimates for repairing the light hail damage on the hood and front fenders. Carfax must have picked up the vin from a body shop estimate software because I do recall visiting a body shop for an estimate on this exact date. Later that year I had a good used hood repainted along with the front of the car and the bumper so everything would match (in the same brand of factory SU and clearcoat).
My list of work is extensive on this car, so I’ve tried to share everything I’ve had done in the description and through my receipts in the gallery. I am an engineer and a hobby mechanic; I really enjoy working on them almost as much as driving them. I could ramble on more about the car here, but I will wait for it to come out in the future discussions.",,Reputation Icon421,1
