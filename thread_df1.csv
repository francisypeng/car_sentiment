https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlj7254gOww
Your car is relatively low mileage for the model year, but even if you keep the car, you should consider fixing the problem. Aside from that, you have a beautiful car and any owner deserves to have peace of mind as they enjoy it, including YOU!",,Reputation Icon47,0
30,31,sje63,"Re: esahmed75
do you have something you can share with me on this problem from MB? To the extent it's feasible and this is indeed a common problem for low mileage cars, I would be open to discussing replacing them if needed - obviously depending on cost. As I've mentioned in prior posts, this car is fully serviced and maintained by MB and I have not received any diagnosis from them on defective head bolts.",,Reputation Icon8,1
31,32,esahmed75,"@pronet the engine number for this car is:
156983-60-017823
The cutoff for the defective head bolts is *60-060658.
So, this car DEFINITELY left the factory with the defective head bolts. I don't see any indication that they were ever replaced in the service history of this car.",,Reputation Icon47,0
