Being the last year of the naturally aspirated V8, it is certainly a desirable vehicle and the rare exterior color and interior trim add to the appeal. I'll be here ready to answer any last minute questions. Thank you all for your consideration and good luck!",,Reputation Icon638,1

Thanks. I think going forward we will have something added in the original description that states that the photos are done with the suspension in the lowest setting. We feel that most of the vehicles that have an adjustable suspension are more photogenic in the lowest setting which is why we do it that way.",,Reputation Icon638,1

Thank you for the questions. The leather/vinyl on the passenger side second row seat has some previous repair. Though it isn't exactly how I would repair it, the work was done so that it will hold for the long term. I squeezed and pushed the seat to check for thenstrength of the repair and it held up very well. Please see the attached close ups and a photo of the other seat next to it for reference.

The third row seats are not removable. They fold up or down into the floor. The reason it looks like they are removed is because in the photos of the seats folded down, there is an all-weather cargo mat that is laid over the floor to protect it so you can not see the seats folded flat into the floor.",,Reputation Icon638,1
34,35,sweeneywinegeek,@MotorcarsOfTheMainLine just thought of another question. Do the 3rd row seats fold down ? In all the photo's you posted the seats are either up or are completely removed from the truck. Thanks,,Reputation Icon2.1k,0
35,36,MotorcarsOfTheMainLine,"Re: kayserfleischer
At present, there are no issues at all with the suspension not is there anything that we can see in the foreseeable future. We have let the car sit for over a week at a time and the suspension did not move. It stayed at the exact height it was left at so in addition to our mechanic not finding any leaks in the system, we confirmed by monitoring the height as it sat. Thanks for the question. Good luck bidding.",,Reputation Icon638,1

timing chain tensioners (yes, these fail on 2013 MO cars also);

water pump and front/rear coolant crossover pipes (these will kill the engine quick);
the rest are just standard maintenance. these are heavy beasts, so control arms/bushings, brakes and other consumables go quick.",,Reputation Icon11,0
