- what affects sentiment score?
	- if it depends on the other variables then it doesn't represent any additional information
	- what if sentiment score is a function of something?
		- only look at certain comments

- try all the different methods, correlation coefficient?
	- different 


- how to evaluate model performance
	- we want to know what is going on?
	- the sentiment scores are not very closely correlated, how to know which one is the best?

	- check correlation between bert and roberta
		- if they are the same then it doesn't really matter, results are robust to the choice of algorithm
		- if they are different, why?
		- what is the crucial difference between the two

- does sentiment score affect the number of bidders?
	- few bidders but they bid more frequently?
	- get the number of bidders

TODO
- check number of bidders
- BERT vs roBERTa
	- correlation, regression with number of bids, normalize

- set sentiment score as y, is it predictable? (don't include price) (include number of bids or number of bidders)

- for literature: sentiment and economics
- where has sentiment score been used empirically
	- where does it matter?
	- what kind of papers can we talk about that have used sentiment
