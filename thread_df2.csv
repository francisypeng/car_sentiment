Difficulty, this car being AWD would need to have the front driveshaft removed. Then, finding a dyno that would accept this car could be another issue.
Sometimes it just isnt a $200.00 fee.",,Reputation Icon8,0

A lot of time and money was obviously spent on installing these mods, so seems crazy to me the seller wouldn't spend ~$200 for a dyno sheet which very well may have helped this vehicle meet the set reserve price.",,Reputation Icon151,0

30,31,Autogeek1001,Sounds like what I did with my Tahoe LTZ. I made a Tahoe SS to look factory but went down the road of supercharger. People always say they did not know a Tahoe SS was made and ask what year. Been thinking of selling it as just take to car shows for last 7 years.
